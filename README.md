## User Story

As a business owner I am in need of an app that allows me to create and edit a company database. This database will keep track of my departments and the job roles in each department. Then it will also keep track of my department managers and their employees. The employees will all have basic information such as first and last name, salary, job title(role), department they work in and who their manager is.

## Version 1

- This employee management app runs by typing "node index.js" in the command line.
- Need to be in the main folder in terminal when running the command.

## How To Use

See the beginning prompt of app below.  
\*![alt text](/public/Assets/images/main_menu.png "Starting Prompt of App")

This main menu holds all the functionality of the app. It is here that you will be returned when you complete each operation. The options are listed below:

#

    View all departments
    View all roles
    View all employees
    View all employees by department
    View all employees by manager
    view all employees by role
    view all managers
    Add a department
    Remove a department
    Add a role
    Remove a role
    Add employee
    Remove employee
    Update employee role
    Update employee manager

- **Note:**
  - When creating database from scratch it is important to start with departments.
  - Then add the roles for each department
  - Then add the employees.
  - **This is important becasue "add", "delete" and "view by" are prompted by lists generated from database**
